          <h2>Purpose of This Page</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of this page is to serve as my digital journal.
            I want a place to document what I’m building so I can recreate anything I’ve done before
            and share what I learn with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before I got into homelabbing, the main problem I wanted to solve was building my own “cloud.”
            That idea, plus a few conversations with coworkers, lots of YouTube videos, and many weekends
            spent rebuilding my homelab after I bricked something, led me here.

  <h2>Deploy Tailscale</h2>

  <p>
    2025-12-17 last updated
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Context</strong> – I chose to install tailscale because I got introduced to 
      the software from a cowrker when I asked how does he connect to his smb when he is 
      not home. Also, I seen some videos while I have been researching homelab applications,
      but seeing the application being using by cowrker in real-time is what made be bite the bullet.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Steps I Took</strong> –
      <ul>
        <li>Starting from the web UI dashboard, select the three lines in the top left corner and choose Apps.</li>
        <li>Go to Discover Apps, select Show All (blue letters below the search), and scroll to Tailscale.</li>
        <li>Select Install.</li>
        <li>In the configure settings you will see “Auth Key*”; generate this from your Tailscale dashboard at
          <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys" target="_blank">https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Create the auth key (title it, set your toggles, generate, then copy) and return to TrueNAS.</li>
        <li>Paste the auth key into the TrueNAS installer, leave the check boxes as-is, and keep the rest of the defaults.</li>
        <li>Scroll to the bottom, install, and confirm the device appears in your Tailscale dashboard.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Issues &amp; Gotchas</strong> – If a subnet shows a timer, double-click the device in the dashboard,
      open Subnet → Awaiting approval, click Edit, check the box next to the needed IP address (e.g., 192.xxx.x), and save.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Notes for Next Time</strong> – not really much to correct, pretty straight forward install!</li>
  </ol>

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>I was in the search of a way on how to access my home lab remotely. Also,
            this was before I learned about Tailscale, how to port forward(definitely will note how to port forward)
            and this suited the job. Along with having a cool domain name to access my home labs</p>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>insert-here</li>
              <li>insert-here.</li>
              <li>insert-here.</li>
              <li>insert-here</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps I Took</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Backed up important Windows data and created a restore point.</li>
              <li>From Windows, shrank the existing partition to free space for Ubuntu.</li>
              <li>Booted from the Ubuntu 24.04 USB installer.</li>
              <li>Chose <em>"Something else"</em> in the installer and manually created Linux partitions.</li>
              <li>Installed Ubuntu to the new partitions and confirmed GRUB was on the main drive.</li>
              <li>After first boot, ran system updates and installed proprietary drivers where needed.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Commands / Shortcuts to Remember</h3>
            <pre><code># Update &amp; upgrade
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# Enable additional drivers GUI
software-properties-gtk
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Issues &amp; Gotchas</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Make sure BIOS/UEFI boot mode is consistent (UEFI for both Windows and Ubuntu).</li>
              <li>
                If the bootloader breaks, boot from a live USB and repair GRUB (for example
                with <code>boot-repair</code> or chroot + reinstalling GRUB).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Notes for Next Time</h3>
            <p>
              Export a list of critical Windows apps before starting. Keep a small
              USB handy with drivers and tools in case networking doesn’t work right
              away on Ubuntu or Windows after changes.

            </p>

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
              During my homelab research, I seen lots of people installing Jellyfin as their media server.
              Also, a coworker of mine heard me mention Jellyfin and got his setup before me which was my
              my breaking point to install it. I wanted a way to stream my own media.
            </p>

            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Would like old and new movies.</li>
              <li>Childhood shows(mandadtory).</li>
              <li>Would like to listen to music as well.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps I Took</h3>
        <ul>
              <li><strong>Starting from the web ui dashboard, select the three lines in 
                the top left corner then select dataset</li>
              <li><strong>Cmd + Tab</strong> – Switch apps.</li>
              <li><strong>Cmd + Shift + 4</strong> – Screenshot selection.</li>
              <li><strong>Cmd + Option + Esc</strong> – Force Quit dialog.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Commands / Run Box Shortcuts</h3>
            <pre><code># Open Device Manager
devmgmt.msc

# System properties
sysdm.cpl

# Power options
powercfg.cpl
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Issues &amp; Gotchas</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Windows Update doesn’t always pull the best GPU drivers—vendor site is safer.</li>
              <li>Watch out for bundled apps or OEM bloat to uninstall early.</li>
              <li>Verify activation status after the install, especially on hardware changes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Notes for Next Time</h3>
            <p>
              Consider exporting a list of installed programs (or using a package manager
              like Winget) so I can rebuild the same setup faster. Also keep a checklist
              of apps to install in a text file inside this journal.

              Ongoing notes for macOS shortcuts and commands that are actually useful
              in daily use and helpdesk work. This is meant to be a quick reference
              when I’m supporting users on Macs.

            <h3>Steps / Shortcuts I Use Often</h3>
            <ul>

            <h3>Terminal Commands</h3>
            <pre><code># Show hidden files in Finder
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
killall Finder

# List disks
diskutil list
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Issues &amp; Gotchas</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Remember to undo hidden files if needed (set back to NO and restart Finder).</li>
              <li>Be careful with <code>diskutil</code> commands—double-check disk identifiers before erasing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Notes for Next Time</h3>
            <p>
              Add more support scenarios here: common Wi-Fi issues, login keychain problems,
              and printer setup steps. This can become a quick reference during helpdesk calls.
